# os-scheduler
CPU scheduling simulator implementing multiple policies

To compile this project, type "make" into cmd line.

To run this project, type "./scheduler <task-file> [policy]"

Students were asked to implement a simple CPU scheduler, which operates three CPU scheduling policies, First Come First Serve (FCFS), Round Robin (RR), and Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF).
The program should take a task list file and command-line arguments as input. Using the specified inputs, the program should output time-slots and their running task.
Then, the program computes statistics of the policy being used and outputs it.
